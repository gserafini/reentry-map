### 📊 Current Infrastructure Assessment

**✅ Strengths (Already Production-Ready for Thousands)**:

- `/api/resources/suggest-batch` - Handles 100 resources/batch with 87% auto-approval
- Autonomous verification (L1/L2/L3 checks, $0.02-0.05 per resource)
- Smart deduplication (exact address + fuzzy name matching with trigram similarity)
- Admin verification queue for flagged resources
- Full audit trail (verification_logs, verification_events, ai_usage_tracking)
- File-based import (`/api/admin/import-files`)
- CLI script support (`scripts/import-resource-files.mjs`)

**🚨 Gaps for Tens of Thousands Scale**:

- No API integration layer (requires manual download → convert → upload)
- No field normalization (each API has different field names)
- No progress tracking for long-running imports
- Sequential processing (1 resource at a time = 28 hours for 10K resources)
- No category mapping configuration (HUD categories ≠ our categories)
- No checkpoint/resume (must restart from beginning if interrupted)
- No rate limit handling (will get blocked by government APIs)

---

### 💰 Cost & Performance Estimates

**For 10,000 Resources Import**:

| Phase           | Time              | Cost         | Notes                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| API Fetching    | 2-4 hours         | Free         | Rate limited by source (60-120 req/min)      |
| Normalization   | Instant           | Free         | In-memory processing                         |
| Deduplication   | 10-20 min         | Free         | Database queries (can optimize with caching) |
| Verification L1 | 28 hrs sequential | $200-500     | Can parallelize to 3 hours with 10 workers   |
| **Total**       | **6-8 hours**     | **$200-500** | With parallelization                         |

**Optimization: Trust-Based Verification**

- Government sources (HUD, SAMHSA, DOL) = L1 only (high trust, minimal verification)
- Web scraped / user submitted = L3 (full verification)
- **Reduces cost 60-80%** for government data

**Expected Auto-Approval Rates**:

- HUD Exchange: 95%+ (government data, high quality)
- SAMHSA: 90%+ (government data, some missing fields)
- DOL CareerOneStop: 90%+ (government data)
- LSC: 85%+ (nonprofit data, some outdated)
- USDA Food: 80%+ (mixed quality)
- Web scraped: 60-70% (variable quality)
- User submitted: 40-60% (requires manual review)

---

### 📋 Recommended Approach

**Start with California-Only Pilot** (Recommended):

**Why California First:**

1. Large state with high reentry population (~500-1,500 resources per source)
2. Good test of scale without full nationwide cost
3. Validates architecture before rollout
4. Limits verification costs ($20-75 vs $200-500)
5. Easier to manually review results for quality

**Pilot Plan**:

1. Implement Phase 1 (foundation infrastructure)
2. Build HUD + SAMHSA adapters (highest priority for reentry)
3. Import California data only (~1,500 total resources)
4. Manually review 10% random sample
5. Measure auto-approval rate, false positive/negative rates
6. Refine verification thresholds if needed
7. Then scale to nationwide

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 85%+ auto-approval rate
- ✅ <5% false positive rate (bad data getting approved)
- ✅ <10% false negative rate (good data getting rejected)
- ✅ Processing time <4 hours for 1,500 resources
- ✅ Cost <$75 for verification

**After Pilot Success**: Roll out nationwide in phases (West Coast → Major Metros → All States)

**Test Results**: All quality checks passing (60/60 tests)

**Next Steps**:

- Replace "RM" logo placeholder with actual logo (user mentioned having one)
- Begin Phase 4: Location Features (geolocation, maps)

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers

1. **ADR-005: UI Library Decision** (⏳ Blocked)
   - Need user decision: HeroUI vs shadcn/ui
   - Affects Phase 1 timeline
   - Recommendation documented in ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
   - **Action Required**: User to review ADR-005 and decide

### Resolved Issues

- ✅ Fixed Vitest setup JSX handling (used React.createElement)
- ✅ Fixed test with multiple "Supabase" elements (used getAllByText)

---

## Key Decisions Made

See ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md for full details:

1. **ADR-001**: Next.js 16 with App Router ✅
2. **ADR-002**: Supabase for Backend ✅
3. **ADR-003**: TypeScript Strict Mode ✅
4. **ADR-004**: Tailwind CSS ✅
5. **ADR-005**: UI Library (HeroUI vs shadcn) ⏳ PENDING
6. **ADR-006**: Vitest + Playwright Testing ✅
7. **ADR-007**: T3 Env Validation 📝 Proposed
8. **ADR-008**: ESLint + Prettier 📝 Proposed
9. **ADR-009**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini ✅
10. **ADR-010**: Google Maps ✅
