## ADR-011: Avatar Strategy with Gravatar and Supabase Storage

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Gabriel Serafini, Claude Code
**Tags**: user-profile, images, storage, ux

### Context

Users need a way to display profile pictures for personalization and identity in reviews and user interactions. The `users` table already has an `avatar_url` field. We need a strategy that balances user experience, implementation simplicity, and cost.

### Decision

Implement a **hybrid avatar strategy**:

1. **Default to Gravatar**: Use Gravatar as the fallback based on user's email or phone hash
2. **In-house uploads via Supabase Storage**: Allow users to upload custom avatars
3. **Fallback hierarchy**: Custom upload â†’ Gravatar â†’ Initials-based placeholder

### Rationale

**Why Gravatar as Default:**

- Zero implementation for basic functionality
- No storage costs for users who don't upload
- Many users already have Gravatar profiles
- Automatic updates when users update their Gravatar
- Reduces initial friction (no required upload)

**Why In-house Storage:**

- Not all users have or want Gravatar
- Full control over image processing and storage
- Better privacy (no external tracking)
- Ability to moderate uploaded images
- Offline-capable PWA support

**Why Initials Fallback:**

- Always shows something meaningful
- Accessible and recognizable
- No external dependencies required

### Implementation Details

#### Avatar Display Priority

```typescript
function getAvatarUrl(user: User): string {
  // 1. Custom uploaded avatar (if exists)
  if (user.avatar_url && user.avatar_url.startsWith('https://')) {
    return user.avatar_url
  }

  // 2. Gravatar (using email or phone hash)
  if (user.email) {
    const hash = md5(user.email.toLowerCase().trim())
    return `https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/${hash}?d=404&s=200`
  }

  // 3. Fallback to initials or default icon
  return null // Component will show initials
}
```

#### Storage Structure

**Supabase Storage Bucket**: `avatars`

- Path pattern: `{user_id}/avatar.{ext}`
- Max file size: 2MB
- Allowed formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Image processing: Resize to 200x200px, optimize quality

#### Upload Flow

1. User selects image in profile settings
2. Client-side validation (size, format)
3. Upload to Supabase Storage with RLS policies
4. Generate thumbnail (200x200px)
5. Update `users.avatar_url` with storage URL
6. Optimistic UI update

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Immediate solution with zero development (Gravatar)
- Future-proof with upload capability
- Cost-effective (Gravatar free, Supabase Storage cheap)
- Better user experience (choice)
- Privacy-friendly (optional external service)
- Works offline (PWA caches uploaded avatars)

**Negative**:

- Need to implement upload UI
- Image moderation may be needed
- Storage costs for custom uploads
- Need to handle image processing

### Security Considerations

**RLS Policies**:

```sql
-- Users can upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Anyone can view avatars (public)
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Users can update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

**Content Moderation**:

- Consider automated content moderation (future)
- Admin flag to disable inappropriate avatars
- Fallback to Gravatar/initials if avatar flagged

### Display Locations

Avatars appear in:

1. **AppBar** (top-right when signed in)
2. **Review cards** (next to reviewer name)
3. **User profile page** (large version)
4. **Favorites list** (optional, in future)

### Component Usage

```typescript
import { Avatar } from '@mui/material'

<Avatar
  src={getAvatarUrl(user)}
  alt={user.name || 'User'}
>
  {/* Fallback to initials */}
  {user.name?.[0]?.toUpperCase() || 'U'}
</Avatar>
```

### Cost Estimate

- Gravatar: **Free**
- Supabase Storage: ~$0.021/GB/month
- Estimated: 1000 users Ã— 50KB avg = 50MB = **$0.001/month**
- Negligible cost for MVP

### Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Gravatar Only**

- Pro: Zero implementation, zero cost
- Con: Many users won't have Gravatar, can't customize

**Option B: Supabase Storage Only**

- Pro: Full control, better privacy
- Con: Forced upload friction, higher costs

**Option C: Third-party Avatar Service (e.g., Cloudinary)**

- Pro: Advanced image processing
- Con: Additional vendor, higher cost, overkill for MVP

### Implementation Timeline

**Phase 5.2** (Authentication & User Profile - Week 3):

- Display Gravatar avatars automatically âœ… Quick win
- Add initials fallback to Material UI Avatar component

**Phase 6.3** (Future Enhancement - After MVP):

- Add avatar upload to profile page
- Implement image processing
- Add RLS policies for avatar storage
- Add moderation tools for admins

### Future Enhancements

- **AI-generated avatars**: Offer generated avatars as an option
- **Avatar frames/badges**: Reward active contributors
- **Social login avatars**: Pull from Google/Facebook if OAuth added
- **Avatar history**: Allow users to revert to previous avatars
