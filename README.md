## Overview

Reentry Map addresses a critical need: people leaving incarceration struggle to find accurate information about resources that accept them. Resource information is scattered, outdated, and hard to search by location.

Our solution is a community-driven, AI-enhanced resource directory that:

- Makes it easy to find resources near you
- Shows which resources accept people with criminal records
- Provides real reviews from people who've used the services
- Keeps information accurate through automated verification
- Works on any device without app store downloads

## Key Features

### For Users

- **Location-Based Search** - Find resources near you with interactive map view
- **Smart Search & Filtering** - Search by category, distance, and keywords
- **Community Reviews** - Read honest feedback from people who've been there
- **Save Favorites** - Keep track of important resources
- **Mobile-First PWA** - Install to your phone's home screen, works offline

### For the Community

- **Suggest Resources** - Know a helpful place? Share it with others
- **Report Issues** - Keep information accurate by reporting changes
- **Rate & Review** - Help others make informed decisions

### For Administrators

- **AI Automation** - Automated resource discovery and enrichment
- **Verification System** - Quarterly checks on phone numbers and websites
- **Moderation Dashboard** - Review community suggestions and reports

## Tech Stack
